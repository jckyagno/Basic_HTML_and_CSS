					<h2>Slant Magazine</h2>
					<p>"Elden Ring is FromSoftware taming the monster they created, not by filing down its teeth and claws, but by giving players the weapons and armor to endure it."</p>
					</article>
					
					<article>
					<h2>Forbes</h2>
					<p>"Elden Ring is a stunning achievement from a literal video game architecture perspective, along with creating a difficult but not wildly punishing game that everyone, even non-Soulsborne devotees, should be able to enjoy. I have not been this impressed with an open world since Skyrim, and Elden Ring even surpasses that in many ways. It’s an easy game to recommend to anyone and everyone, and deserves the explosive sales success we’ve seen, dwarfing old FromSoft records. Elden Ring is a gaming achievement the likes of which we rarely seen, and you will be remiss to not pick it up and see what the hype is about for yourself."</p>
					</article>
					
					<article>
					<h2>The Enemy</h2>
					<p>"More than anything, we must always stress that, yes, the Lands Between — the open world, therefore — is the main highlight. In an era taken by mediocre open-world games, it's refreshing to see that a company new to this concept got it so precisely right. There's no doubt about it: this is, indeed, one of the best games of recent years. If you're a fan of Open Worlds, no matter what level of challenge you're used to, give it a go. The chances of regret are almost zero. We often think of FromSoftware games in extreme ways. I love it. I hate it. It's amazing. It's unbearable. Elden Ring does bump into these dualities, but tends to be much more attractive to the public in general."</p>
